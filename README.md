# Cisco-OSPF-Protocol
In this Cisco project, I designed a scalable and efficient IP network using VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking) and implemented OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) as the dynamic routing protocol. The goal was to create a structured and optimized network that supports multiple subnets and allows fast, reliable routing between them.

## 📋 Objectives

- Configure multiple routers using **OSPF**.
- Use **VLSM** to subnet IP address ranges according to host requirements.
- Establish end-to-end connectivity between different networks.
- Simulate the network using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.
