# Cisco-OSPF-Protocol
In this Cisco project, I designed a scalable and efficient IP network using VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking) and implemented OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) as the dynamic routing protocol. The goal was to create a structured and optimized network that supports multiple subnets and allows fast, reliable routing between them.
